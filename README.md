# Integration-Services-Automation
**Automation mechanisms for the Integration Services with Power Shell**

The main task is to automaticly interact with the Integration Services Catalog. All objects of SSISDB can be created or deleted. In addition environments with all variables can be copied to the same or another instance. 


An overview of the SSISDB Objects can be found here:
